342-Lab-3-File-Comparison
=========================

An assignment from the first C++ course in the major. 

We had to implement a file comparison tool based on linked lists. The program compares the prime fibonacci bytes of the files.
Then there is a consecutive byte comparison, where it is determined that files do no match after one mistmatching character.
